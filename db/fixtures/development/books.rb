    Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of
    Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who
    formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her
    cash. Raskolnikov, in attempts to defend his actions, argues that with the
    pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime,
    while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a
    theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such
    actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout
    the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares
    his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.

    of Kerouac and his friends across America. It is considered a defining work
    of the postwar Beat and Counterculture generations, with its protagonists

    published in 1957, is a roman à clef, with many key figures in the Beat
    movement, such as William S. Burroughs (Old Bull Lee) and Allen Ginsberg

  book.title = 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'
  book.description = <<-DESC.squish
    A 1967 novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez that tells the
    multi-generational story of the Buendía family, whose patriarch, José
    Arcadio Buendía, founds the town of Macondo, the metaphoric Colombia.

    The magical realist style and thematic substance of One Hundred Years of
    Solitude established it as an important, representative novel of the
    literary Latin American Boom of the 1960s and 1970s,[1] which was
    stylistically influenced by Modernism (European and North American) and the
    Cuban Vanguardia (Avant-Garde) literary movement.

    One Hundred Years of Solitude was first published in Spanish in 1967; it has
    subsequently been translated into thirty-seven languages and has sold more
    than 30 million copies.[2][3][4] The novel remains widely acclaimed today,
    and is considered by many to be Márquez's masterpiece.
